# Project 1

CART 253 - With Professor Barr
by Azmat Ishaq

This is a game where you can play as Gabe Newell or a Half Life fan. The objective, if you are Gabe, is to avoid the fans from convincing you to make Half Life 3. Just dodge, what they throw at you. Make sure your CONVINCE BAR doesn't fill to the max! If it does, Gabe will have to make Half Life 3 and you will lose the game.

If you are a fan, your objective is to fill the CONVINCE BAR to the max in order to persuade.

Use the arrow keys to move your character. Use the space bar to launch objects if you are a fan.


This is the README file for the entire project. For more official projects you should write information here about the nature of the project, your name, any special explanations of how the project works, etc.
